This website is built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It serves as a central hub for my writing, projects, and contact information.

## Key Features

*   **Responsive Interface:** I'm a design freak. Few things I love more than creating a UI.
*   **Blog:** Dead-simple blog interface using markdown files--easy for me to create, edit, and push to main.
*   **Contact Info:** Easy way for visitors to figure out how to get in touch with me.
*   **Custom Logo:** I'm no graphic designer, but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. Created using some simple vector design software.
