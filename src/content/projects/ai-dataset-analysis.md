This project involved a deep dive into a medium-sized AI training dataset produced during RLHF training. I explored some findings and potential pivots in strategy.

## Key Points

*   **Data Quality Assessment:** Comprehensive evaluation of dataset, identifying deep patterns
*   **Natural Language Processing:** Evaluation of writing via python libraries
*   **Visualization:** Created detailed visualizations to communicate complex findings effectively

## Methodology

To analyze the dataset, I started with simple pivot tables, then moved deeper using various python libraries for natural language processing and statistical analysis. For data visualization, I used a number of formats common in AI analysis, such as heatmaps, Q-Q plots, and more.
