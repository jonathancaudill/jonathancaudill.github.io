For years and years, MacOS has been slowly refined. With OS X came a new design language and the introduction of a Unix-like filesystem. With Big Sur came a new, flatter design, in keeping with the slightly translucent aesthetics of the early 2020s. With Tahoe, clear Liquid Glass has been put everywhere. It's gorgeous.

But you know what isn't gorgeous?

### Stickies.

#### The oft unloved, unrecognized Mac app that languishes away in a "Utilities" folder.

Its sharp corners, lack of traffic lights, and bizarre transparency scheme are an eyesore on a modern operating system.

So this is my fix. As someone who takes a lot of little notes throughout my day on my desktop, I wanted something that was simple and beautiful. It's built with Rust and Tauri, and looks right at home on a modern desktop.
