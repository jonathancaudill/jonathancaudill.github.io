# CSS Tips and Tricks

Here are some CSS tips and tricks that can help you improve your web design skills:

## Using CSS Grid

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that allows you to create complex web layouts with ease.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 20px;
}
```

## CSS Variables

CSS variables (custom properties) allow you to store specific values to reuse throughout your stylesheet.

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #3490dc;
}

.button {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
}
```

These are just a few examples of how you can leverage CSS to create beautiful and responsive web designs.
