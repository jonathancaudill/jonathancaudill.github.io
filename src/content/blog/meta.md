Meta. What is there to say about the social-networking monolith that hasn’t been said a thousand times over? It’s an economic bastion of strength, and nothing about that is poised to change anytime soon. I’d like to spend a little time breaking down their most recent finances (currently from March, though we’ll of course get some more data soon)!

|                  |         |
|------------------|---------|
| Revenue TTM      | $170.4B |
| CapEx TTM        | $43.8B  |
| FCF TTM          | $52.3B  |
| Share Buybacks   | $28.6B  |
| R&D Spend        | $46.0B  |
| Operating Margin | 44.4%   |
| Debt             | $49.1B  |
| WACC             | 10.4%   |
|                  |         |

Look at that—$52.3 billion in free cash flow. Unsurprising for a company of their size, but it’s nevertheless remarkable how much cash on hand they maintain while reinvesting as aggressively as they do: $46.0B on R&D, and $28.6B back to shareholders as they continue to regain control of their stock. Their WACC is at a challenging 10.4%, and it’s worth noting that this is almost entirely from equity. Debt only make up a tiny fraction of their capital structure, and while this comes with some loss of tax breaks, it signifies the fiscal firepower at Meta’s disposal. They rarely have any need to borrow these days, and are able to finance their own goals with cash. In keeping with their vise grip on the social-networking space, they’re betting on their own continued market share.

It’s quite interesting to see how they’re allocating their capital these days. As usual, an insanely large portion goes straight back into corporate growth: $89.8B between R&D and CapEx. As of late, a lot of this is going into building the AI infrastructure CEO Mark Zuckerberg is so bullish on. As Meta continues to make bold decisions, they’re planning for future boardroom calls by buying back their own stock—thereby ensuring that a higher percentage of profits continues to go into growth.

Meta’s debt is relatively low: just $49.1B. That’s low enough that they could pay it off today with liquid cash. Of course, they’ll continue to hold onto their safety fund of $52.3B, as Zuckerberg pushes for the continual acceleration into the AI-verse—a venture that could prove extremely lucrative, but is unproven in terms of government regulation or widespread market usage, both factors that could make or break its growth. During a recent earnings call, Zuckerberg opened with his opinion on the major theme of Meta’s current strategy: focusing resources on “how AI is transforming everything we do.”

Meta works in a world with a lot of skepticism, as well as very high investor expectations (just look at their 10.4% WACC, based almost entirely on investor returns). And they’re pushing into a world that has even *more* of that: the race for AI dominance. Zuckerberg clearly feels that heavy reinvestment is the path towards investor confidence and long-term gains. It needs to be, if investors are to remain confident. It’s hard to not sense some of Zuckerberg’s legacy weighing in here. It’s hard to feel that a no-name CEO would be able to signal this kind of confidence. Zuckerberg’s history of riding the start of “the next wave” is surely helping him in his pitch to investors: if we get AI and the metaverse right, the profits will be sure to come.

While everyone and their mother has an opinion on Mark Zuckerberg’s business strategy, I do think a couple things are worth pointing out. First of all, the virtual reality race has slowed down. While sales remain relatively strong, the flopping of Apple’s pricey Vision Pro headset served as a halter for the industry, and the buzz has largely petered out. Meanwhile, AI is being forced into every corner of our lives—sometimes with great success (ChatGPT has helped me learn about countless topics) and sometimes with less (Meta’s AI bots have had a very hard time gaining regular users). As usual, the first company to do something revolutionary and do it well often experiences the most success. Meta’s AI chatbots, late to the game as they were, are hardly transforming user experiences across their platforms. It is worth noting that Meta is leveraging their AI infrastructure behind the scenes, using it to fine-tune the personalized ads served to and data collected from their userbase. In the short-term, at least, this will likely prove far more profitable. 

It remains to be seen whether Meta’s AI team will be able to produce something that changes the core of their company, but Mark certainly believes so. From an investor perspective, he’s been right about so much—why should he be wrong about this? Only time will tell. If there were one thing I would nudge Meta in the direction of, it would be a return to their focus on the “metaverse.” AI is hot right now. This gives them the perfect opportunity to engineer something truly incredible and debut it at a time when no one is ready for it. If Meta can’t win the AI race, maybe they can kick off the next one.
